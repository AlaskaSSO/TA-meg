This is a Splunk Technology Adapter for Mcafee Email Gateway (referenced by meg in the rest of this document);  the nomenclature has changed in recent releases to be called a "splunk add-on".  This app uses the classic naming.

TA-meg expects incoming data to be of sourcetype=meg.  Mcafee Emailgateway has the ability to push logs our in a large amount of formats.  TA-meg will attempt to support EVERY format provided by Mcafee Email Gateway.  As of version 0.0.1 it supports the "splunk log format", and then "CEF log format".  I strongly recommend the "splunk log format" as it is most tested.

If you run an alternative or custom format send me a sample and I will support that in the next release (which will be accelerated).

Because of the many formats supported the props and transforms are a little bit spaghetti and not 100% consistent.  I don't use all features of Mcafee Email Gateway, and as such not all fields are mapped as I cannot test them.

Request: Please send me sample logs which I can test with!  Some redacted sample logs I have collected are in the samples directory.
